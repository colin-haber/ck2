# Crusader Kings II mod tools
This extension provides Crusader Kings II mod support for Visual Studio Code. Right now, it&rsquo;s just syntax highlighting, but future support for more sophisticated features like IntelliSense is anticipated.

##Use
Because <abbr title="Crusader Kings II">CK2</abbr> mod files by default have <code>.txt</code> file extensions, you&rsquo;ll need to rename your mod files to <code>*.ck2.txt</code>. The extension will automatically work its magic on any file with this file extension. You will need to add a <code>replace_path</code> line to the <code>.mod</code> file to make sure the files you have changed are still overwriting their original counterparts. To enable syntax highlighting for your <code>.mod</code> file, change its file extension to <code>.ck2.mod</code>.

##Features
*	<code>.ck2.txt</code> Syntax highlighting
*	<code>.ck2.mod</code> Syntax highlighting
